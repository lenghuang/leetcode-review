# leetcode-review

This is my attempt at making a Duolingo-esque website for Leetcode style questions. At first, the questions will be simple and the data will be hardcoded. But slowly, I'll grow this to become a more personalized and engaging experience so you can prepare for interviews anywhere anytime.

## Project Structure

- `archive` contains some old code that I gave up on but want to keep to look back on
- `scripts` contains Python scripts that I used to create questions
- `site` contains NextJS application to create the frontend
- `extension` contains a Chrome Extension I used to sync data between Leetcode and my database

Tech stack includes tools like:

- Frontend: NextJS, Supabase, Zod, Shadcn
- Backend: Python, Baml, Openrouter
- Misc: Reading from Leetcode's GraphQL

## Setup / Contribution

- TODO. Would be nice to make this open source so people can self host / contribute, but will do that when this is a bit more organized / maintainable / actually has users.
