// Here, create a page where users can view different study sets
// Think play lists, but for flashcards

// We can also make a view all flashcards page
// Can filter by topic, question, etc

// Then, allow user to choose a question template, and fill in the answer for them

// We can have some kind of "universal" question and answer generated with ChatGPT per question.
// Can maybe feed official LC solution to the prompt if available.
// then we can see if we can create questions based on user's submissions
